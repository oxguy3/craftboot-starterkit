craftboot-starterkit
====================

This repo is a supplement for my project [CraftBoot](https://github.com/oxguy3/craftboot). The goal of this subproject is to provide a set of scripts and other resources for modpack managers to make it easier to get set up with CraftBoot. Basically, I'm too lazy to take on the massive task of making a complete GUI for setting up modpacks, so I'm making this to at least provide _something_.

Until I have this ready to go, I recommend you use [the Getting Started guide](https://github.com/oxguy3/craftboot/wiki/Getting-Started) to get set up with CraftBoot.
